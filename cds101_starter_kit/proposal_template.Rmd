## 1. Dataset

Dataset Name: CarDekho Vehicle Dataset
Source / Platform: Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho)
**Short Description:**
- What does this dataset contain?
* This dataset contains used-car listings from CarDekho, including details about each vehicle.
- What are the main variables (features)?
* The dataset has variables like car name, car year, selling price, mileage, fuel type, seller type, transmission, and number of owners.
- Approximate number of rows / columns?
* The dataset contains about around 4,300 rows with 9 coloumns.
- Why is this dataset interesting or relevant?
It is useful for analyzing what factors affect used car prices and for building prediction models. For example, factors like how mileage,year, fuel type influence prices.

## 2. Dataset Link

Paste a direct URL to the dataset (or documentation) here:

## 3. Research Question

Which car features, like mileage, engine type, etc, have the strongest
effect on vehicle price?


---

## 4. Modeling Approach / Models Used

Describe what you plan to do analytically.

- Type of task (check all that apply):
  - [x] Exploratory analysis only  
  - [x] Regression (predicting a numeric value)  
  - [ ] Classification (predicting categories/labels)  
  - [ ] Clustering / unsupervised patterns  
  - [ ] Other (describe)

**Planned models / methods:**

1. Import the CarDekho dataset into RStudio.
2. Clean the dataset: remove missing values, shift columns to correct data types, and select
relevant variables.
3. Create summary tables and visualizations showing how price varies by mileage, brand,
engine size, fuel type, and transmission.
4. Build predictive models such as simple linear regression and multiple regression to see
which features best explain price changes.
5. Compare model performance using metrics like RMSE and R² to decide which model
works better.
6. Interpret the results in simple terms so the patterns are easy to understand
**Planned evaluation metrics:**

Examples:  
- Regression: RMSE, MAE, \(R^2\)  
- Classification: accuracy, precision/recall, F1, confusion matrix

## 5. Expected Results

What do you expect to find? It’s okay if this changes later.
* We expect year, mileage, and engine size to be the strongest predictors of vehicle price.
* Newer cars and cars with larger engines will likely have higher prices.
* Cars with high mileage and certain fuel types will generally have lower prices.

---

## 6. Potential Challenges (Optional)

Some entries have missing values and incorrect data types.
- How might you handle or mitigate these issues?
* we Reduce these issues with clean the dataset by removing and imputing missing values and converting columns to correct data types.
